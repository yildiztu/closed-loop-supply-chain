# GAMS - Closed Loop Supply Chain (CLSC)

Many business activities take place within a supply chain. Therefore, in a typical supply chain system, numerous business processes interact. On the other hand, supply chain optimization studies are dedicated to some various smaller parts of a whole business system; often the big picture is left unseen. Moreover, many studies focus relatively small theoretical optimization models using various methods. However, there is a huge potential of opportunities; as such, reducing the overall costs and waste, when the supply chain system is viewed as a complete “closed-loop” structure. The term “closed-loop” refers to both integrated systems of a forward and a reverse chain. In this regard, by taking into account of the practical outcomes of both forward and reverse chain system optimization; this study presents a model of a more realistic supply chain system with an optimization source code.
